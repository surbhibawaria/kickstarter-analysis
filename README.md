# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of the Project
Louise, who wanted to start a crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play _Fever_ estimated a budget of over $10,000 and was understandbly hesitant about jumping into her first fundraising campaign. So to help Louise kickstarting her production, crowdfunding data was analyzed and organized to make the campaign successful and help her gain a better undderstanding of the campaigns from start to finish.

In a short amount of time, Louise's play _Fever_ came close to reaching its fundraising goal, and now she wanted to know how different campaigns performed in terms of their launch dates and funding goals.
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals.
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
To analyze outcomes based on launch date, first pivot table was created showing the successful, failed and canceled projects by month for 'theater'. A line chart was then created based on the pivot table to visualize the data for a better understanding.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
To analyze outcomes based on goals, percentages of successful, failed, and canceled projects were calculated using goal ranges with subcategory 'plays'. A line chart is created with the goal-amount ranges, the percentage of successful, failed, or canceled projects.

After analyzing the data of _theater outcomes by launch date_ , following conclusions can be drawn.

1. Based launch date, the campaigns have higher success rate trends in the months of May, June, July and lower success rate trends in January, March, September, November. Hence, starting a _theatre_ campaign in May, June, July suggests the highest success rate over the other months of the year.
2. The month of December have lowest success rate and seems to have similar outcomes for both the success and the failure of the campaigns.

### Conclusions about the Outcomes based on Goals

After analyzing the data of _outcomes based on goals_, the success rate of plays seems to be 75% if the goal is $1000, it is 60% if the goal is $5000. But, if the goal is increased to say upto $19000 to $20000 the success rate will drop to 50%. And with the further higher campagin goal range of $25000, $45000 or above there is higher chances of campaigns to be a failure. Therefore, it can be concluded that theatre play campaign might have a higher chance for becoming a success if the campaign goals are kept as limited as possible.

### Limitations
Although the dataset represented good contribution to analysis, but there are limitations to the kickstarter data. There was no recent data available for the past few years which could have helped with a better analysis of the current trends. Additional data from the social media platforms and public reviews would have also helped. Categorizing the theater plays even further like Romance, Thriller, Comedy etc, would have helped in a deeper analysis.
