# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of the Project
Louise, who wanted to start a crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play _Fever_ estimated a budget of over $10,000 and was understandbly hesitant about jumping into her first fundraising campaign. So to help Louise kickstarting her production, crowdfunding data was analyzed and organized to make the campaign successful and help her gain a better undderstanding of the campaigns from start to finish.

In a short amount of time, Louise's play _Fever_ came close to reaching its fundraising goal, and now she wanted to know how different campaigns performed in terms of their launch dates and funding goals.
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals.
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
To analyze outcomes based on launch date, first pivot table was created showing the successful, failed and canceled projects by month for 'theater'. A line chart was then created based on the pivot table to visualize the data for a better understanding.

1. Based launch date, the campaigns have higher success rate trends in the months of May, June, July and lower success rate trends in January, March, September, November. Therfore, starting a _theatre_ campaign in May, June, July suggests the highest success rate over the other months of the year.
2. The onth of December seems to have almost similar outcomes for both the success and the failure of the campaign.
